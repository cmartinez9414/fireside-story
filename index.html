      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>and the github directions were not working!</p>
      <p><em>"PANIC</em>!!!!" was on the minds of our fellow coders.</p>
      <p>If only there was some way to fix this!!!</p>
      <p>Our TF Steve had a great tip to use HTTPS instead of SSH,</p>
      <p><b>and the problems were fixed!</b></p>
      <p>The coders were amazed! Never have they seen such a beauty in the struggle!</p>
