      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
      <p>and the github directions were not working!</p>
      <p><em>"PANIC</em>!!!!" was on the minds of our fellow coders.</p>
      <p>If only there was some way to fix this!!!</p>
      <p>Our TF Steve was skeptical that the SSH would work,</p>

      <p><b>The problems were fixed!</b></p>
